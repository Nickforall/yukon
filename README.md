## Hello, world

Yukon is heavily in development, things will be ugly, things will break. Feel free to play
around with it, I would love to get feedback on how to design and develop Yukon, or my Rust code.

## Compiling

The compiling step is currently performed by [Esprit](https://github.com/dherman/esprit).
Yukon's code is purely a virtual machine for now.
